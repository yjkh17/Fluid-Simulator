# FluidSimApp Architecture

## Overview

FluidSimApp is built using a modular, testable architecture that separates concerns and maintains clear boundaries between different layers of functionality.

## Core Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected rather than created internally
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation between View, ViewModel, and Model layers
- **Metal Performance**: GPU-accelerated computation for real-time fluid simulation
- **Reactive Programming**: Combine framework for data flow and state management
